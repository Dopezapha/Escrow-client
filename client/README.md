# UI for Escrow Smart Contract 

## Overview

This user interface provides a seamless interaction with our Advanced Secure Escrow Smart Contract deployed on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to create, manage, and interact with escrow transactions in a secure and user-friendly environment.

## Features

- Create new escrow transactions
- View and manage existing escrows
- Release funds to sellers
- Refund buyers
- Dispute resolution
- Extend escrow timeouts
- Rate completed transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet browser extension)

## Usage

1. Connect your Stacks wallet to the application.
2. Create a new escrow by providing seller, buyer, and arbiter addresses, along with the amount.
3. Manage your escrows from the dashboard.
4. Perform actions like releasing funds, refunding, or disputing as needed.
5. Rate the transaction upon completion.

## Styling

The UI is styled using CSS modules for component-specific styles and a global CSS file for common styles. This approach allows for easy customization and maintenance of the application's look and feel.

## Security Considerations

- Always verify transaction details before signing.
- Keep your wallet's private keys secure and never share them.
- Be cautious when interacting with large amounts.
